The plot of the magic empire revolves around a wonderful magical world in which there are magical characters from different camps. The player will act as a MEMP warrior, choose one of the camps, and use the character cards in the camp to win the final magic victory. In a world full of magic, a series of extraordinary characters will appear one after another.

------


Characters have different fighting statistics, fighting styles and skills. You will have to face fierce creatures or hard-to-handle real players, and fight in a card game style with a clever combination strategy based on five factions. The interface in MEMP is simple. The most interesting aspect of MEMP is that players collect and upgrade cards, gems and treasure chests to defeat their opponents. Therefore, if you have a deck with stronger combat data than the enemy, victory is easy.
