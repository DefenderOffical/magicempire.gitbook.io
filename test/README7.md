**PvP Mode**

Each round, the winner will be automatically calculated according to the system algorithm-each card will have an attribute. The system will randomly allocate player stats. We will find the winner based on the comprehensive probability calculation. You can use SKILL CARD to increase the overall probability to increase your winning rate.

 

*Power: which side has the higher stats => win rate increased by 20%

*Defence: which side has the higher stats => win rate increased by 20%

*Counter: a card with a counter stat, if the opponent is an engraved system => increase the win rate by 5%

 

After that, the AI will calculate and randomly return the result based on the win rate. The Reward is determined by level according to the following formula : 

 

*Battle reward = from (level * 1500) to (level * 6500).

*Final reward = battle reward + (combat reward * bonus reward).

*The probability of obtaining all items is as follows:

| Side   | Wooden Chest | Silver Chest | Golden Chest | Diamond Chest |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| Winner | 35%          | 30%          | 20%          | 15%           |
| Loser  | 45%          | 45%          | 5%           | 5%            |

*You will receive the item regardless of the result, win or lose.
